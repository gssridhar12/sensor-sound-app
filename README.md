# Sensor Sound Control

Control sounds and tempo using device sensors!

## Features

    Explore a list of sounds from Freesound.org.
    Play sounds with a tap.
    Adjust playback tempo based on device movement.

## Best Practices

    Clear Code Structure: The code is organized into separate components (UI, data fetching, sensor handling) for better maintainability.

## Specific Enhancements

    Sound Caching: Cache fetched sounds for offline use and faster loading.
    Alternative Tempo Mappings: Explore more fine-tuned tempo mapping techniques for a more responsive experience.

## Getting Started

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/sensor_sound_app.git

    Install dependencies: flutter pub get

    Run the app: flutter run

## Usage
